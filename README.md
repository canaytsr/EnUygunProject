## PetStore Project

In this project, the available, sending and sold parameters were sent to the petStore service and the tests were carried out.
Unirest and httpResponse were used for this.

When find status is called, the get method is called by taking the third pet id through the returned pets.

Finally, post and delete tests were written for pet id.

While writing test methods in the project, Unirest, httpResponse and Rest assured were used.
